It is primarily used for source code management (**SCM**) in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.\"\n\nGit is the actual software reponsible for tracking changes and managing collaboration between team mates. It can be used as a client and/or a server.\n\nIn our case, we will focused on the client side, since the server side will be handled by GitHub.\n\nThe default user interface is a command-line interface.\n\nE.g. a set of command to initialise a repository and commit a change.\n\n```bash\ngit init\ngit add README.md\ngit commit\ngit remote add origin git@github.com/cdowm/thats.git\ngit push -u origin master\n```\n\nGit must not be mistaken with GitHub, we will see their differences in the next section.",
